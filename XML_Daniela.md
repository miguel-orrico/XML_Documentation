# What is XML?
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language designed to store and transport data.


## XML Does NOTHING
It's just information wrapped in tags, focused on organizing and describing data

# What is XML Used For?
- Exchange data between systems
- Store structured information
- Configure applications
- Define web services
- reate other markup languages

## XML Tree Structure
XML documents are formed as element trees.
An XML tree starts at a root element and branches from the root to child elements.
The terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships between elements.

Parents have children. Children have parents. Siblings are children on the same level (brothers and sisters).

- *XML Documents Must Have a Root Element*
- *All XML Elements Must Have a Closing Tag*
- *XML Tags are Case Sensitive*
- *XML Elements Must be Properly Nested*
- *XML Attribute Values Must Always be Quoted* 

## XML elements
An XML element is everything from (including) the element's start tag to (including) the element's end tag.
An element can contain:
- text
- attributes
- other elements
- or a mix of the above
### An element with no content is said to be empty.

## XML Naming Rules
XML elements must follow these naming rules:
- Element names are case-sensitive
- Element names must start with a letter or underscore
- Element names cannot start with the letters xml (or XML, or Xml, etc)
- Element names can contain letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods
- Element names cannot contain spaces

## Difference Between XML and HTML
|XML|HTML
|--------------|--------------
Describes data | Displays data
|Custom tags | Predefined tags
|Strict syntax | More flexible syntax
|Focused structure | Focused on presentation

### XML is Often a Complement to HTML
In many HTML applications, XML is used to store or transport data, while HTML is used to format and display the same data.


## Advantages and disadvantages of XML

|Advantages | Disadvantages
|-----------|---------------
Clear and structures data organization | More verbose than formats like JSON
Clear and structured data organization | Larger file size due to many tags
Widely supported standard | Strict syntax can make it less forgiving
Good for complex data exchange |
