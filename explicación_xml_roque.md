# ¿What is XML?
***
## XML is a type of file that is used for *data storage and transfer*, making it **readable** for the people.
***
## It ***must*** have: 
- A "root element".
- Closed tags.

## It may have:
- Another elements (childs or siblings).
- Attributes to add more information.

## The *main differences* we can observe are:
### For example, a comparison with HTML.
|| XML | HTML |
|----------|----------|----------|
|Introduction| Easy to understand, only for data storage and transfer | Has a lot of tags, attributes and is the most common thing in all pages |
|Syntax| You can put whatever name tag you want, but it must have a root element and closing tags | Has to be structured, with semantic meaning, opening and closing tags and you can include classes and ids |
|Elements| An element is a "tag" inside another | The elements are structured, but could have for example an element surrounded by a div (another element)|
|Attribute| XML uses this to provide "extra information" | HTML tags can have a lot of attributes, and each one can have more than one, for example one section could have a class and an id at the same time |

## USAGE EXAMPLE. 
- A company that has resources and wants the data structured and organized.

- The company could use XML for storing and sending data.

- The company would add the main tags, such as the root element, and then add the correct tags to structure the data.

- The company could add attributes to add extra information and/or sibling or child elements to make data more clear.
