# XML Introduction

## Introduction: What is XML?

XML focuses on **carrying data**, concentrating on what the data is, sharing it efficiently, and in a way that is easy for people and machines to understand.

## Difference with HTML

It differs from HTML, which focuses on **displaying data** and is more concerned with appearance.  
- **XML** is a markup language used to **store and transport data**.  
- **HTML** is more concerned with **displaying data**.

## Uses of XML

On its own, XML does **nothing**. But not entirely…  

- **Data storage**: XML is used to store data in a structured and organized way.  

Someone has to write software to do something with it; on its own, it does nothing.  
XML is similar to JSON: you have data, and each app can do whatever it wants with it.  
In the past, each app used to store data however it wanted.
