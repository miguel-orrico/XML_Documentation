# UsesOfXML

**On its own, XML does NOTHING. But not entirely…**

- **Data storage:** XML is used to store data in a structured and organized way.

**Important facts:**

- Someone has to write software to do something with it; on its own, it does nothing.  
- XML is similar to JSON: I have this data, and you do whatever you want with it.  
- Each app used to store data however they wanted.



# XML Doesn't has "Default" Tags
- **You can make your own tags! The Author gets to define them themselves, like  <start> <middle> <end>!**

# XML is easy to read!
	- **XML is easy to read for both Humans and Machines and offers us a safe store-transport of data available
	to all readers!**


# XML Tree Structure

- XML is structured as a **tree** with a **root element** and nested **child elements**.  
- Relationships: **Parent → Child → Sibling**.  
- Elements can have **text** and **attributes**.  

### Syntax
- **XML documents must contain one root element that is the parent of all other elements:**

- Starts with a **prolog**: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`  
- Each element must be **opened and closed**.  
- Elements can contain **attributes** and **other elements**.
