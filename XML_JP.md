## XML Introduction
Diferences between XML and HTML
| XML | HTML |
| :--- | :--- |
| Designed to carry data | Designed to display data |
| Simplifies things | More complex |
| Does NOT do anything | Essential to show information |
| Tags not predefined | Tags predefined |

## XML Tree
* XML Tree starts at a root element
* All elements can have sub elements
* XML Documents are formed as element trees
* The terms used are parent, child and siblings
* Siblings are children on the same level, branch from the parent

## XML Syntax
* XML documents must have one *root* element (parent)
* The *XML prolog* is optional. If it exists, it must come first in the document.
* All elements *must* have closing tag.
* Tags are case *sensitive*.
* All elements *must* be properly nested.
* In XML, an error in the document typically causes the parser to *STOP* processing.

## XML Elements

* An XML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
* Elements can contain text.
* Elements can contain other elements.
* Elements can contain attributes.
* Elements can be empty.
* Empty elements can be written as self-closing tags.
* XML element names are case sensitive.
* Element names must start with a letter or underscore.
* Element names cannot start with numbers or punctuation.
* Element names cannot begin with "xml".
* Element names should not contain spaces.
* It is recommended to use descriptive names.

## XML Attributes

* XML elements can have attributes.
* Attributes provide additional information about elements.
* Attributes are written inside the start tag.
* Attribute values must always be in quotes.
* An element can have multiple attributes.
* Attribute names are case sensitive


## XML Prolog

* The XML prolog is optional.
* It must be written at the beginning of the document.
* It defines the XML version.
* It can define the character encoding.

## XML Comments

* Comments are used to add notes inside the document.
* Comments are ignored by the XML parser.
* Comments are written between <!-- and -->.
* Comments cannot be placed inside a tag.

## Well-Formed XML

* An XML document must follow all syntax rules.
* There must be exactly one root element.
* All tags must be closed.
* Elements must be properly nested.
* Attribute values must be quoted.
* XML is case sensitive.
