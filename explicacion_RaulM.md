# What is XMl?
XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language and was designed to store and transport data and to be self-descriptive.
### XML Does not anything
XML is just information wrapped in tags
Example:

`<note>`

  `<to>Tove</to>`

  `<from>Jani</from>`

  `<heading>Reminder</heading>`
  
  `<body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>`
  
`</note>`
## Difference between XML and HTML
XML was designed to carry data while HTML was designed to display data and the XML tags are not predefined

# XML SYNTAX
Every XML must have a Root element 

### XML Prolog
* The XML prolog is optional but if exists it must come at the beggining of the document.

* Defines the version and character encoding

* UTF-8 is the default encoding

### All XML Elements must have a closing tag
Example:

`<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`

### XML tags are sensitive

This means that opening and closing tags must match

### XML values must be quoted
Example: `<note date="12/11/2007"`

* Comments in XML cannot contain "--" inside
